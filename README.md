The NFL Game Win Probability Model is a statistical and machine learning-based approach to predict the likelihood of a team winning at any given point during a game. 
By analyzing historical game data and in-game events such as scores, time remaining, and field position, the model identifies patterns and key factors that influence outcomes. 
Leveraging machine learning tools like regression analysis, the model provides real-time insights and probabilities to enhance strategic decision-making for analysts, coaches, and fans. 
This comprehensive framework supports data-driven predictions, making it an invaluable asset for understanding and forecasting game dynamics.
